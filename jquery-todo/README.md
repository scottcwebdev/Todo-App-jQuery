jQuery Todo
=========================
Front-end todo application made with jQuery.

My goal for this application was to get my hands dirty with jQuey, handlebars.js, and using the browsers localStorage. Furthermore, I tried to organize my code in accordance with the MVC software architectural pattern.

The biggest challenges were setting and retrieving data from localStorage while maintaining it's state after browser refreshes, accessing the correct DOM elements with jQuery, and suprisingly using sprites to generate the checkboxes (hat tip: Ryan T Brown https://gist.github.com/ryantbrown/d23df28d2af0703d40d1c75e007d6754)
